# neural-network-image-classification
Classification of MNIST Fashion datasets.

This repo contains prototyping notebook and the saved, trained model (in .h5 file format).

*Note: The training data and the pickled dataframes from the notebook are not saved.*

## Objective

To build a model that will predict the class of an image.  The classes are:
  - 0: Sneaker
  - 1: Boot
  - 2: Shirt
  - 3: T-shirt

*Note: This task has been given to me as part of a data science boot camp.  The y_test data was not provided and is used to score the model after submission.  If this was a standalone project then I would split the data into training and testing sets but this is not necessary here as a testing stage is integral to submission.*
